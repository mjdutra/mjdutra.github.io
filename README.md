# Sushi Guide 

## Purpose of the Sushi Guide

"Sushi Guide" is my first website, created as part of my Web Development project. Inspired by a love for traditional Japanese culture, I wanted to design a site with a Japanese aesthetic. The site serves as a fun, informative guide to sushi, featuring some details such as history, types of sushi, some recipes and images for sushi lovers. Through this project, I explored web design and development, combining my interest in Japanese style with the technical skills I learned.
